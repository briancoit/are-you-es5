A package to help you find out which of your `node_modules` aren't written in ES5 so you can add them to your Webpack/Rollup/Parcel  transpilation steps. This is currently [limited to checking the entrypoint scripts only](https://github.com/obahareth/are-you-es5/issues/2), which **might** actually be enough of a check to determine if a package should be transpiled or not.

## Installing

You can install the package globally with

```bash
npm install -g are-you-es5
```

or if you'd rather just run it immediately you can use npx:

```bash
npx are-you-es5 check /path/to/some/repo
```

### Aliasing
If you've installed it globally and find it tiresome to type `are-you-es5` a lot, you can alias it to `es5`:

```bash
alias es5="are-you-es5"
```

# Upgrading from 1.1

If you were on version 1.1, the `-a` or `-all` option used to be for logging all messages, this has now changed to `-v` or `--verbose` and `-a` and `-all` are now used as a flag to check all node modules.

## Usage

```
Usage: are-you-es5 check [options] <path>

Checks if all node_modules (direct dependencies only) at <path> are ES5

Options:
  -a, --all      Check all node_modules instead of just direct dependencies
  -v, --verbose  Log all messages (including modules that are ES5)
  -r, --regex    Get babel-loader exclude regex to ignore all node_modules except non-ES5 ones
  -h, --help     output usage information
```

### Example

```bash
are-you-es5 check /path/to/some/repo -r
❌ @babel/plugin-transform-block-scoping is not ES5
❌ @babel/plugin-transform-object-assign is not ES5
❌ @babel/plugin-transform-parameters is not ES5
❌ @babel/preset-react is not ES5
❌ @babel/register is not ES5
❌ @rails/webpacker is not ES5
❌ babel-plugin-lodash is not ES5
❌ lodash-webpack-plugin is not ES5

Babel-loader exclude regex:
(You should manually remove Webpack and Babel plugins from this regex)

/node_modules/(?![@babel/plugin-transform-block-scoping|@babel/plugin-transform-object-assign|@babel/plugin-transform-parameters|@babel/preset-react|@babel/register|@rails/webpacker|babel-plugin-lodash|lodash-webpack-plugin])/
```

## TODO

* [#2](https://github.com/obahareth/are-you-es5/issues/2) - Also check against all scripts required by entrypoint script, this should work for all JS module types.

## Credits

- [acorn](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn) - All the actual ES5 checking happens through acorn, this package wouldn't exist without it.
- [es-check](https://github.com/dollarshaveclub/es-check) - This whole package wouldn't have been possible if I hadn't come across es-check and learned from it.
